        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Droughts happen when rain insufficiency hits a place for a long period of time, hence causing an acute water shortage. Though often confused with the dry spell, droughts often last longer and are more dangerous. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Prolonged drought can cause a serious economic crisis while also posing threats to the human population and other living creatures as well. In such a case, a country’s agricultural sector usually suffers the most—leaving people battling with food insecurity.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Droughts are usually very unpredictable due to their slow nature of development. However, simple signs like reduced rainfall during rainy seasons can be an indication of a drought build-up.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Other possible signs of drought include unusually extended periods of sunny weather, reduced water levels in lakes and other water sources, and the yellowing or wilting of plants.    </section>

            CO2 Emissions
        </h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless gas that is highly important to life on Earth. CO2 is also known as a greenhouse gas; an excessive concentration can disrupt the natural regulation of temperature in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.

            The concentration of CO2 has especially increased as a result of the Industrial Revolution and exponential growth in manufacturing activities around the world. Deforestation, agriculture, and fossil fuel use are the primary sources of CO2.      
            
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            We can take a look at the top fifteen CO2 Emitting countries to notice how the emissions continue to grow year after year. Note this y-axis is measured in (Million Metric Tonnes) so a value of 1 is approximately 985,206 tonnes.

            From the graphic, we can see that the top five countries that produced the most CO2 are China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan.

            Global Temperature Changes
        </h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2020. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available. Data are based on the publicly available GISTEMP data, the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS).        </p>

                Analyzing U.S Precipitation

                <br/>
                TODO: Discuss this graphic? Are there any trends? Or can we use this graphic to talk about the results of precipitation are still in debate?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Climate scientists generally agree on how different parts of the Earth will warm, there is much less agreement about where and how precipitation will change.
                Increased moisture will not fall evenly across the planet. Some areas will see increased precipitation, while other areas are expected to see less due to shifting weather patterns and other factors.
                On average, warming is expected to result in dry areas becoming drier and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in mid- and high-latitude areas.
                <br/>
                Scientists also generally agree that precipitation, when it does occur, will become more intense nearly everywhere. Unlike average annual precipitation, almost the entire world is expected to see an increase in extreme precipitation as it warms.

            Scientists suggest most of the world will have a 16-24% increase in heavy precipitation intensity by 2100. In other, words, heavy rain is likely to get heavier.
            <br/>
            We can take a look at the last 100 years of precipitation to see if we notice anything. We can see in the late years of the visualization that rainfall has become more intense in the coasts but 
            drier inland. Global warming can play a factor in this extreme weather

                Simply cutting beef out of your diet can cut 20% out of your carbon emissions. Just by reducing your beef and lamb consumption, you can reduce your carbon footprint by a lot.
